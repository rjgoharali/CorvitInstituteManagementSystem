# Education Platform

A modern, React + Vite frontend application for managing students, teachers, courses, attendance, and user roles in educational institutions.

## 🖥️ Frontend Only

This repository contains **only the front-end code** — no backend, no server, no API.  
All files are pure React components built with TypeScript.  
Perfect for static hosting on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

### 🚫 Not Included
- Backend services (`auth.ts`, databases, APIs)
- Build configs (vite.config.ts, package.json)
- Environment variables or authentication logic

Everything here is UI — ready to run in a browser.
